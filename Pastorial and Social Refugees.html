                            <p style="text-align:justify;">PSRS is a Pastoral Unit of the Catholic Diocese of Kigoma which renders pastoral and social services specifically to refugees who flee from their home countries due to wars and insecurity. PSRS is currently serving refugees from Congo DRC and Burundi who fled from Civil war and Genocide in Burundi and Rwanda since 1994 respectively. The service is rendered by the Diocese of Kigoma in collaboration with the Congregation of Holy Ghost Fathers (Spiritans) based in Nyakitonto, Kasulu. The Pastoral and Social Services ware previously discharged by Caritas Department, but later the Diocesan Authority deemed it worthy to establish an independent unity for effective pastoration of the people of God in Camps. Previously the PSRS unit used to serve in Mtabila, Nyarugusu, Mtendeli, Mkugwa, Nduta, Muyovosi and Lugufu camps. But since there has been signs of stability in Burundi and Rwanda, refugees have been going back on voluntary bases with exception of Nyarugusu in such a way that currently we are remaining with Nyarugusu Camp. Mutabila camp which comprised of Burundian was officially closed on 31st December, 2012, forcing about 3,000 burundian refugees who could not dare going back, fearing their security mix with the Congolese refugees in Nyarugusu Camp. Currently the PSRS has four (3) priests, one religious brother, 18 Cathechists and several lay leaders who serve about 73,000 refugees in Nyarugusu of whom 70,000 are from Congo DRC and 3,000 from Burundi. </p>
          
                            
                            
          <h5> Situation in the Camp</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">Confining such a large population in a single place has given rise to various social and moral problems in Nyarugusu camp. It is against problems such promiscuity, drug abuses on the part of youths, sense of despair, hypertension and developing sense of irreligious and lack of fear of God that we are trying to fight as we discharge our duties. To such people we have been visiting, counseling, encouraging and giving material and Moral Support. We also give material support to most vulnerable groups among the refugees such as the aged, orphans and the sick. In response to the problems in question we hold a number of activities in the Camps </p>
                            
          <h3 class="fw-bold">Overall Goal</h3>

                               <p class="text-justify">In the camps we came to realize that the population was growing very high. Through several sensas done by the government and the Church it was observed that the growth rate was very high, to such people in the refugee situation to have many children would add to the already miserable economic situation they had. Hence we need to continue conducting such seminars on the married people on the importance of using Natural family planning</p>

                               <p class="text-justify">In collaboration with our With the Diocesan Women and Gender unit (WID/GAD) we plan to conduct seminars on women’s role in Peace Building and reconciliation emphasizing that women could be good instrument in reconciling the societies especially those affected by civil wars.

                               </p>

                               <h6><span class="fw-bold">(i)</span> Remuneration for pastoral agents</h6>
                               <p class="text-justify">When we talk of pastoral agents we hereby refer to catechists, priest and lay leaders who volunteer to evangelize in the camp. Currently there are three priests (3) one religious brother (1) and Eighteen (18) catechists serving in Nyarugusu Camp. The refugees in their situation cannot sustain their pastors through collections, tithes and the like as it is usually done in pastoral fields under normal circumstances. They themselves need to be sustained by the International community and other stakeholders. Hence pastoral agents who provide spiritual supports in the camps such as priests, catechists need to be support. While Thanking Missio Achen for their valuable support, without forgetting the Diocese of Kigoma for what she has been contributing locally, I once more appeal to Mission Aachen to continue supporting our pastoral activities in the camp as before. We assure you our continued prayers.</p>
                               <h6><span class="fw-bold">(j)</span>  Sports and sportive activities </h6>
                               <p class="text-justify">We intend to continue encouraging sports and sportive activities. We plan to have tournaments every year in the fields of sports. We hope to organize sport competition for youth groups. We aim at enhancing competitions in football, netball other sportive activities keeping in mind that sports are necessary for health body and mind without forgetting its role in cementing social relations among people.

                               <p class="text-justify">We budget to supply the faithful with liturgical articles which cannot buy on their own. We plan to buy hosts, vestments, liturgical books, candles which shall be used during sacramental and liturgical cerebration in the Camp. We plan to make minor maintenance of the Church building in the camp. For the choirs supported will be provided to buy and maintain the musical instruments s etc.</p>
                               <h6><span class="fw-bold">(l)</span> Fuel and car maintenance</h6>
                               <p class="text-justify">Nyarugusu camp is about 50km from the Nyakitonto centre where priests serving in the camp do stay for they are not allowed by the international community laws to stay in camp. This distance requires them to travel every day to the camps and back. Hence the need of fuel for their transport. For PSRS Coordinating Office. -Equally for the Diocesan Refugees Coordinator, the activities to carried out will involve the monitoring and evaluation meetings which were held by pastoral agents. -Pastoral council meetings for refugees: Normally we meet twice a year and we had met to evaluate and plan on how best could we serve our brothers and sisters in the camps. -Meeting of Catechist to arrange calendar: each after 3 months- food and fuel and fare -Meeting with lay leaders -Making a follow up of a written permission to enter in the camp, Kigoma – Katubuka (fuel), Dar Es Salaam (air ticket fair to and fro) -Attending an annual meeting for immigrants to TEC (once a year)- fair and traveling allowance -Celebration of Immigrants day every on ……budget for it. Planning, needed materials and foods & drinks -Purchase of Stationery – files for PSRS, realms for records and reporting, pens, etc -Sacraments celebrations such as confirmation (transport fuel )- fuel and allowance -Purchase of New Car for PSRS pending on availability of funds from donor, present one is old got an accident previously is always on maintenance and costly new one will reduce such costs and give curtaining of journeys towards providing services to the refuges.</p>
                               <h3 class="fw-bold">CHallenges </h3>
                               <p class="text-justify">PSRS Dependency Syndrome: Given their situation, Refugees as it were, cannot financially support by themselves the work of evangelization. Likewise the Catholic diocese of Kigoma, with meager resources at her disposal cannot but partially subsidize what is required for this special apostolate. Hence the rationale of requesting Missio’s kind intervention to serve the purpose. Lack of realible means of transport: The lack of a vehicle is one of the major challenges of PSRS Unity. Considering the location of Mutabila camp and the distance between the camp and the coordinating office in Kigoma, it becomes very difficult to access the camp with no means of transport. The Old vehicle for the unit got an accident in 2006 and due to its age, it is beyond repair. Summary of the Challenges and planned intervention and target group NO PROBLEM INTERVENTION/SOLUTION/ACTIVITY TARGET GROUP 1 Promiscuity and Immoralities in the camp among the Youth Seminar on Youth and Christian Life Youth groups 2 Hypertension rampant among the adults (impact of war) Counseling sessions of traumatized people Adults and affected people 3 Limited Peace and Security in homeland Seminar on Conflict resolution and Reconciliation Women & Young people 4 Beliefs in which crafts – Syncretism Bible Seminars, Seminars on Christian Teach and witchcraft.

<h3 class="fw-bold" >A Concluding Remark and Aknowledgement Note</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">With regard to personnel, the department still lacks enough trained staff as compared to the present work load. The departments lacks the competent Secretary, Sales and marketing personnel, Fundraising expert, Estate manager (for lands and plots), Expert in Agriculture and It Technician.</p> 
                            <p class="text-justify">The department is also in dare need of some Material resources such as plots or lands which are legally owned for putting up buildings, for farming, business, manufacturing industries etc. Department is also uncomfortable with the lack of Machinery and Equipments for offices, agriculture, factories and so on. Relevant software are also highly needed for daily office operations.</p> 
                            <p class="text-justify">Needed are also Financial resources. The Department is required to maximize collection of funds from traditional sources of funds such as church collections, donations and small business such as Nzimano, soap factory etc. New sources of Funding also need to be established to complement the existing ones. These include levies from Parishes, Educational institutions, other institutions, projects and Personnel working outside the Diocese. We need to create reserve fund for investments and emergencies. Likewise we need to create common funds for upkeep of church personnel.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Moreover, We need to venture into new investments. This requires the department to utilize plots available by building commercial complex, residential blocks or apartments, by building modern commercial schools etc. Investing in agriculture is a must if food and commercial farming are intended by Finance Department. We equally see the need of investing in manufacturing and processing Industries such as food processing, fishing and packing, soap and soft drinks and the like</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Since the management of Church property is among the primary duties of the department, we need to put in place the use of available rules, policies and regulations such as staff manual regulation, financial manual, statutes and handing over procedures. Trainings and seminars to the church actors are the core of our responsibility and are highly needed. Squrely, the control, monitoring and evaluation of church properties through meetings, supervision, reports and audity remain a priority to be implemented by this particular department. We need to plan the proper and economical use of the acquired land for the benefit of the Church (Diocese of Kigoma). Needed is likewise the proper and comprehensive statistics and stock keeping if management of the dioceses’ properties are to considered. Resources Available.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">The department is not without resources which if properly used can lead to attainment of her goals. Resources include Personnel and Christian faithful, Lands and plots, buildings, Motor Vehicles, Office fittings, furnitures and Equipments, funds although are not enough </p>
